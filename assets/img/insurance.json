It covers the intrinsic value of stolen or damaged property and damage caused during such events.

Renewal and endorsement services are available, though the insurer is not obligated to accept renewal premiums. The insured is expected to cooperate fully, maintain proper security measures, keep accurate records (such as daily cash logs), and safeguard keys to ensure smooth claim settlement and continued coverage."
